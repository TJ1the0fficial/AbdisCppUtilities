  Hi, I am a programmer, who likes C++, but not good at it. I am not an expert, but I like    language and I am ambitious.
  
  Ok, so here's a little summary of my work.

  So for now there is only one file (2025.Nov.19. Kitchen sink utility file).
  AbdisCppUtilities.hpp
  This file contains functions made so your job in programming will be easier.

  Utilities:
    - print() : 
        With print() you can print text to the console almost like in Python.
        The only issue is that you can't join text via '+', but you can use ',' and it              won't add weird space between.
    - input() :
        Works almost like the input in Python, but it has the same flaw like the print()            function.
    - to_lower() :
        Lowers all cases.
    - to_upper() :
        Uppers all cases.
    - random_in_range() :
        This is a practical way to make a random number between two numbers
        Works with ints and doubles.
        Steps are in consideration.
    - print_vector() :
        It simply prints a vector in a pretty way. Also, you can set a style to it.
        If you modify the code, you can even add your own styles to it.
