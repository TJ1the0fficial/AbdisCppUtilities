  Hi, I am a programmer, who likes C++, but not good at it. I am not an expert, but I like    language and I am ambitious.<br>
  
  Ok, so here's a little summary of my work.<br>

  So for now there is only one file (2025.Nov.19. Kitchen sink utility file).<br>
  AbdisCppUtilities.hpp<br>
  This file contains functions made so your job in programming will be easier.<br>

  Utilities:<br>
    - print() : <br>
        With print() you can print text to the console almost like in Python.<br>
        The only issue is that you can't join text via '+', but you can use ',' and it              won't add weird space between.<br>
    - input() :<br>
        Works almost like the input in Python, but it has the same flaw like the print()            function.<br>
    - to_lower() :<br>
        Lowers all cases.<br>
    - to_upper() :<br>
        Uppers all cases.<br>
    - random_in_range() :<br>
        This is a practical way to make a random number between two numbers.<br>
        Works with ints and doubles.<br>
        Steps are in consideration.<br>
    - print_vector() :<br>
        It simply prints a vector in a pretty way. Also, you can set a style to it.<br>
        If you modify the code, you can even add your own styles to it.<br>
